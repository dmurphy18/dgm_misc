This diectory holds the current install repo rpms's for the various Redhat OS's.

Note: The Fedora install rpm is not functional, since the baseurl needs to be adjusted 
      if we decide to host Fedora packages on repo.saltstack.com, for example:
      yum/fedora/releases/<various names, e.g. WorkStation>/24/x86_64
